# Java Programming to implement Vigenere Breaker

As a part of this course cyptography techniques like Caesar Cipher and Vigenere Cipher alongwith 
algorithm to break the cipher was implemented. An Integer Key or String was used to encrypt text,
so a algorithm was implemented to reverse the encryption on text that was done using previous cipher.
Data files and implementation is provided in the folders respectively. Week 4 contains final 
implemented Mini-Project for Vigenere Breaker.
