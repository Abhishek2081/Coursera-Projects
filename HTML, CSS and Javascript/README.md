# HTML, CSS and Javascript

The Project is designed in an online platform codepen.io and later files were exported. The mini Project and Assignments
are from Coursera Course named HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Main Objective of these mini - projects were to study Html,
css and javascript concepts and apply in using of canvas, document uploading and performing operations on images like 
blurring, creating composite, red,blue,rainbow,gray filters, steganography(hiding one image into another). This helped
me to learn how images can be used and coded to bring desired changes and filters, crop and work on pixels of such images.
It Helps to clear your Javascript concepts to a great extent also learnt how Green-Screen Algorithm is used in Movies for 
animation.
